Arduino Music Sequencer
Workshop Overview:
This course is designed to introduce "physical computing" - the construction of hardware/software systems that sense and interact with the physical world.
Students will construct a simple electronic music sequencer, a monome, using Arduinos (hardware/software tools for building electronics projects) and Processing (a visual programming language for artists).
